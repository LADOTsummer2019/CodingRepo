                    <h2>Common Exercise</h2>
                    <p> The following are common exercises that we encourage our cliennts to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
                    <d1>
                        <dt> Burpee </dt>
                        <dd> Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strenght and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward. kick your feet back and then forward again quickly and then jump
                        up from a squatted position</dd>
                        
                        <dt> Plank</dt>
                        <dd> Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up poistion and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can</dd>
                        
                        
                        <dt> Mountain Climber</dt>
                        <dd> Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).
                        </dd>
                    
                    </d1>
